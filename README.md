Finding plant diseases is a crucial challenge in plant pathology and agriculture. The usage of pesticides can be reduced, crop losses can be avoided, and productivity can be increased with timely and precise disease identification in plants. Automated systems for plant disease diagnosis have attracted a lot of attention as a result of developments in computer vision and deep learning. ResNet (Residual Neural Network) is a deep learning architecture that has transformed picture categorization jobs. It was first introduced by Kaiming He et al. in 2015, and since then, it has excelled at a number of computer vision tasks, including detecting plant diseases. ResNet is renowned for its capacity to solve the vanishing gradient problem and train incredibly deep neural networks.
